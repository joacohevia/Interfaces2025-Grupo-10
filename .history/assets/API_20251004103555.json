"description": "The third game in a series, it holds nothing back from the player. Open world adventures of the renowned monster slayer Geralt of Rivia are now even on a larger scale. Following the source material more accurately, this time Geralt is trying to find the child of the prophecy, Ciri while making a quick coin from various contracts on the side. Great attention to the world building above all creates an immersive story, where your decisions will shape the world around you. CD Project Red are infamous for the amount of work they put into their games, and it shows, because aside from classic third-person action RPG base game they provided 2 massive DLCs with unique questlines and 16 smaller DLCs, containing extra quests and items. Players praise the game for its atmosphere and a wide open world that finds the balance between fantasy elements and realistic and believable mechanics, and the game deserved numerous awards for every aspect of the game, from music to direction."

"description": "Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. Its plot directly follows the first game&#39;s, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her... Portal 2&#39;s core mechanics are very similar to the first game&#39;s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them. The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities. Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor."

"description": "A cinematic revival of the series in its action third person form, Tomb Rider follows Lara in her least experience period of life – her youth. Heavily influenced by Naughty Dog’s “Uncharted”, the game is a mix of everything, from stealth and survival to combat and QTE action scenes. Young Lara Croft arrives on the Yamatai, lost island near Japan, as the leader of the expedition in search of the Yamatai Kingdom, with a diverse team of specialists. But shipwreck postponed the successful arrival and seemingly forgotten island is heavily populated with hostile inhabitants, cultists of Solarii Brotherhood. The game will be graphic at times, especially after failed QTE’s during some of the survival scenes, but overall players will enjoy classic action adventure, reminiscent of the beginning of the series. This game is not a direct sequel or continuation of existing sub-series within the franchise, but a reboot, setting up Tomb Raider to represent modern gaming experience. The game has RPG elements and has a world, which you can explore during the story campaign and after the completion. As well as multiplayer mode, where 2 teams (4 scavengers and 4 survivors) are clashing in 3 game modes while using weapons and environments from the single-player campaign."

"description": "Gordon Freeman became the most popular nameless and voiceless protagonist in gaming history. He is painted as the most famous scientist and a hero within the world of Half-Life, and for a good reason. In the first game he saved the planet from alien invasion, this time, when the invasion is already begun, the world needs his help one more time. And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. What is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats. For a story-driven FPS, Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery, and making in-game mechanics feel natural, be it platforming or driving."

While exploring the underwater city, players will complete missions for the last sane inhabitants of Rapture, while fending off the less fortunate ones."

"description": "It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre"

"description": "The fourth game in the post-apocalyptic action RPG series from Bethesda studious brings players back to the retro-future. After customizing the facial features of the character, players will be admitted to the Vault 111 with their family, and tricked into entering the cryogenic capsule.

The classic group of Hoxton, Dallas, Chains and Wolf got reinforcement, and now Payday Gang consists of 21 heisters, some of which are based on movie characters or even Youtubers. Players will be able to customize their own private arsenal, their masks, and skills, to complete the missions in their own way, be it stealthy sneak-in or full frontal assault. After completing missions, players will receive EXP points, money and a chance to get a special item that can be a gun modification, mask or a safe containing weapon skins. Payday 2 is a multiplayer game, meaning, that even during offline missions players will be followed by AI characters, whose loadouts, masks and perks can be customized as well. This game has been supported by the developers for many years, and amount of DLC speaks plenty of their dedication to the player base."

"description": "Return of the classic FPS, Doom (2016) acts as a reboot of the series and brings back the Doomslayer, protagonist of the original Doom games. In order to solve the energy crisis, humanity learned to harvest the energy from Hell, and when something went wrong and a demon invasion has started, it’s up to the player to control the Doomslayer and destroy the evil. Doom is a fast-paced game that restores the concept of instant health packs and leaves the player against armies of Hell with no cover, no health regeneration, or help from anyone. After damaging monsters enough, they will start glowing, which will allow players to perform glory kills to restore some health. While exploring the levels, players will come across secrets, collectible items, or upgrade points for the weapons and armor. The single-player campaign silent protagonist has a noticeable personality. He gets visibly annoyed and angry in his actions during expository cutscenes and forces his way through the game. Multiplayer maps gather players in Deathmatch/”king-of-the-hill” type game modes, with all the weapons from the single-player campaign."

"description": "Horizon Zero Dawn is an experiment. A very impressive experiment that actually succeeded. Having a very curious mix of cyberpunk and prehistorical styles and esthetic, the game provides us with quite a unique experience. We need to arm ourselves with arrows and a bow, with a spear or any other prehistorical-ish weapon in order to defeat out enemies - dinosaur-mechanisms that are spread around the world. If that wasn't enough, Aloy our main protagonist can control an AI named GAIA. What we're having here is an exciting connection with 'very old times' and 'near future', even though the game is set up in the 31st century. Being an outcast with her father Rost, Aloy must restore her position in the tribe and save the world by stopping the Eclipse, a cult that wants to rule the world. Join her on that journey, exploring the world and people that live in such hard surroundings."

"description": "Not all post-apocalyptic stories begin in the burned wastelands, this time nuclear and chemical locked up survivors in the Moscow Subway, and player will take the place of Artyom, one of the survivors from the VDNKh, adoptive son of the station commander, and taking upon himself the task to deliver information about the Dark Ones to the Polis, the capital of subway, after the special operative from Spartans named Hunter went missing, after he ventured to gather information on the Hive – living space of the Dark Ones. Dark tunnels of broken subway create a claustrophobic atmosphere, where good and bad people alike are forced to bond. Closely following original book, Metro 2033 introducing bullets as currency. Players can exchange one type of bullets for another one, but it’s still ammo and will be wasted with inaccurate aim. It’s a first person shooter that will allow players not only see how broken apart can society become but to explore such society and ruins of the city above the underground settlement. Various monsters and mutants are not the only threat to the players, but humans as well. FPS with some stealth sections, Metro 2033 will show you every historical enemy type: bandits, Communists, and Nazis."

"description": "The Witcher is the very first instalment of the series that follows the story of Geralt from Rivia. Being found unconscious on the battlefield he must retrieve his memory and help the emperor&#39;s daughter, Adda to stop her from turning in to a feral monster. Facing the biggest enemy, Salamander, Geralt must also help all the fractions around the world to find peace between each other. The fighting system is very flexible. Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well. The game never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad anyway. Enhanced edition improves every aspect of the game as graphics and the productivity of it, while Director&#39;s Cut does the same without censorship for North America&#39;s version."

"description": "Essentially a tech demo, “Half-Life 2: Lost Coast” sole purpose was to show off the new high-dynamic-range-rendering of the Source engine, it was a welcome addition to the franchise. It’s a free addition to the game that can be downloaded through Steam by the owners of Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman founds himself near a group of decaying piers, fully armed and ready to explore the monastery above him, fighting through the Combine forces. High-dynamic-range-rendering introduced realistic lighting effects to the game, emulating even camera’s overexposure to the bright light, which was eventually moved to the main game. Lost Coast story is conveyed without cutscenes, every part of the level is tailored specifically to demonstrate the changes, made by developers. Even though it was originally created for the Half-Life 2, it was removed from the main game, alongside some minor story details. It’s not a full standalone game and wasn’t intended as one."

"description": "Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry. Most of the game&#39;s story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions. The game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. The Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable."

"description": "Half-Life is the original game in the series. Being a revolutionary at the time, we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa. Arriving late at work and hastily doing his routine he runs into the experiment field. However, the experiment goes completely wrong and opens a portal to a completely different dimension called Xen. The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal. One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more."

"description": "Direct continuation of the Half-Life 2, Episode One serves as a direct sequel to the story. After the mystically assisted escape from the citadel, Gordon and Alyx are reunited outside, but the Citadel core became unstable and will imminently self-destruct. And the only way to save citizens of City 17 is to re-enter the decaying building and slow down the destruction for long enough, to evacuate the civilians and families. Continuation of the story uses the same Source engine, and players will have to traverse linear stages, disposing of enemies and solving physics puzzles. This time Gordon will be accompanied and assisted by Alyx. Her AI will attempt to adjust to the player choices. While purchasing Episode One, players will receive a copy of Half-Life: Deathmatch with it. Game mechanics and puzzles will center around Gravity Gun, which will be the first weapon in players possession from the beginning."

"description": "Right after the escape from the collapsed Citadel, Gordon Freeman and his companion Alyx Vance learn that Combine used the destruction to open a portal, in order to bring powerful reinforcement. No major changes have been applied to the gameplay since the previous episode, instead, players will be invited to experiment with the gravity gun and more physics objects to use as impromptu ammunition. Episode Two brings back every staple of the series, including physic puzzles, driving sections, because it was developed simultaneously with the Episode One, but unlike first one Episode two has more puzzles, including the biggest puzzle in the series up to date."

"description": "Upon the release of Half-Life 2 players were greatly disappointed in one thing, and that’s the lack of multiplayer. Granted, single-player campaign of Half-Life 2 was impressive, but weapons that have been demonstrated in it made players curious. They questioned if the experience was complete because the first Half-Life included multiplayer mode from the beginning. Valve took the criticism and published Half-Life 2: Deathmatch – multiplayer only addition, based on the main game, which was a separate product, distributed on Steam. The game includes two major modes, which are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Both modes have similar rules. Players must kill as many other players as possible, to gain points. Player or team with the most points win, and points are retracted for self-killing and team killing. Players can expect fast-paced matches with instant respawns."

"description": "Dark Souls III is the fourth installment in the Dark Souls series, now introducing the players to the world of Lothric, a kingdom which has suffered the fate similar to its counterparts from the previous games, descending from its height to utter darkness. A new tale of dark fantasy offers to create and guide the path of game’s protagonist, the Ashen One, through the dangers of the world before him. Sharing many gameplay similarities with previous installments of the Souls series, Dark Souls III improves at what it is best. These features are the unforgiving difficulty and unique, overwhelming environments. Let alone the soundtracks, allowing players to travel through the familiar locations and encounter new obstacles alike, resulting in a great test of nerves, while also giving the fruit of resolving the secrets and echoes of the past of Dark Souls series. The new changes to the systems of multiplayer, crafting and combat will offer new and experienced players to challenge themselves on the field of battle, and to enhance the playthrough with each consecutive New Game +, where the in-game cycle never indeed ends, allowing for a multitude of different playstyles, and showing different events based on player’s actions."

"description": "The hero (in the beginning you can choose gender, name and appearance) - an office worker who inherited an abandoned farm. The landscape of the farm can also be selected. For example, you can decide whether there will be a river nearby for fishing. The farm area needs to be cleared, and it will take time. The hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying. The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close. The game does not set any ultimate or primary goal, its many possibilities are designed for an unlimited time."

"description": "BioShock is set in an alternate dimension in 1960. Our main protagonist Jack is the sole survivor of a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean. With help, he gets to the Rapture - underwater city created by Andrew Ryan that wanted to create a utopia. After arriving in the city, however, he discovers Little Sisters and Big Daddies, and it is clear to Jack that there is something not okay with the city. Being a first-person shooter, BioShock works with an active weapon and a plasmid, on the other hand, giving the player the ability to use some supernatural powers and developing unique combos with it. Many of the weapons have different types of ammunition that are effective against some specific types of enemies. Same goes for plasmids, as you need to know weapon will be effective. By retrieving EVE, you will be able to fill your resources and use plasmid once more. Although the economics of the game is more complicated as you need to gather money for refilling resources and ADAM for purchasing new skills for your plasmid. In Remastered edition, games framerate and technical issues being fully fixed making this a modern-looking game."

"description": "Refreshing look of Mirror’s Edge made this first-person action platformer recognizable even by people who have never played it before. The City of the “utopian” society is highly monitored by the totalitarian military groups. Players will take control of the female protagonist, named Faith, a specially trained Runner, master of parkour that delivers physical documents in the city, where every form of communication is watched. Her sister is framed for murder, and Faith must follow the clues to the identity of the murderer, with only lead being a note saying Icarus. Distinct visuals of the game form the bright white city, which Faith has to navigate through, jumping across rooftops, running on walls and climbing scaffolding. Color-coded elements of the environment guiding players as to where they can progress. Special attention to the camera that will bob up in down in accordance with the movement, trying to recreate the actual vision, and not a fixed video feed. Even though Mirror’s Edge has a combat system, it’s not the main focus, which makes it scarce."

"description": "Hitman is a six episodes game with different contracts. The action takes place as a prequel to Hitman: Agent 47 (only prologue) and episodes take place six years after Hitman: Absolution. All contracts are being ordered by a 'shadow client' and seem to be unrelated. But as you fulfil those contracts, you start to realise that all of the targets somehow are a part of a secret organisation called the Providence. While playing Agent 47, you have a large amount of free will in completing those contracts. The main target is all that matters, and you can do anything to kill this person in your style and fashion. You can disguise as a different person and infiltrate secured area to perform the kill manually or use a long-range sniper rifle to do the trick. Your surroundings help you a lot as well by listening to nearby chat or news reports. Players are given as much freedom as possible to find your professional style in the art of killing. A large amount of DLC and expanded missions can either give you gimmick-based contracts and travel to Japan, Serbia and other countries."

Fluid and tight combat includes various melee and ranged weapons, that can be used as intended or just thrown at the enemy. Once Jacket, dubbed so for his distinct letterman jacket by fans, arrives at the mission, players will have to clear out every floor from the enemies, using rooms and doors for cover or ambushes. As the story moves on, Jackets mental health will visibly deteriorate, and he will be shown to suffer from hallucinations, which is in tone with acid 80’s theme."

Outlast follows the story of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, that got the lead on the inhuman experiments, performed on the asylum patients. Outlast forces players to run away from danger, simply because there is no combat system. All Miles can do is to document what is happening inside the Mount Massive Asylum. Players do not have a flashlight, only a night vision camera, which constantly requires batteries in order to function. Miles will be pursued through the halls, rooms, yards and enclosed laboratories by distressed and aggressive inhabitants. Over the course of the game, players will have to solve puzzles by locating and collecting items and travel through the Asylum with realistic movement animation and horror sting sound effect, in order to make players sympathize with the protagonists."

It was two years after the accident in Human Revolution, where augmented people started to act uncontrollable and aggressive. As it turns out, a rogue group called Illuminati made it look like a proof for their instability and now augmented people are living like outcasts. We follow Adam Jensen once again as he works as a double agent for Interpol and a hackers group called Juggernaut Collective to confront the Illuminati and reveal the truth. The core gameplay of Mankind Divided hasn&#39;t changed much except minor changes like no need for batteries anymore because your energy bar slowly regenerates itself back and a non-killing politic. You can beat the game without killing anyone making Mankind Divided a big morality question for the player as he walks it through."

"description": "PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS is battle-royale shooter made only for the multiplayer experience. Players should do their best to become the last one alive. Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don’t actually affect the gameplay."

"description": "Path of Exile is inspired by Diablo II and follows it basically in most of the aspects. Randomly filled pre-set of locations, heavy grind and a possibility of replaying most of the areas leaves us with only one possible outcome. Players wake up on grim shores of Wraeclast. Without any knowledge who we are or what have we done, players must start to explore an aggressive and cruel fantasy world of criminals, bandits and murderers. Discover the mystery of a long forgotten the Eternal Empire, and survive. Mechanics are pretty simple. Choose one of six different classes, gather gems for more skills to use and grind good and synergising equipment. Due to replaying, you can grind any needed equipment or resources to buy it from vendors. Infinite loop of gameplay will still be challenging. The cooperative mode allows beating the game with a party of friends up to six people at the same time."

"description": "Titular best-selling psychological thriller author was going through a writer’s block, but when he tries to take a small vacation, it seems that he is attacked and has to fight off the “darkness” that possess people and animals alike. Action-adventure with horror elements, Alan Wake is paced like a thriller show, cinematic and slow, which is in alignment with the visual style of the rural region of Washington and linear storytelling. The main enemy, encountered by the players will be Taken – possessed by darkness creatures and humans that cannot be attacked outright, because they are shrouded in black smoke, blocking the attacks. Only after dispelling the darkness with a source of light players are able to affect the enemies. When the enemies are getting too close, Alan can perform a slow-motion dodge. Two more episodes were published for the first game, called “The Signal” and “The Writer”, directly continuing the story of the main game, and completing the first season."

"description": "Garry&#39;s Mod or simply GMod is a source-engine based modification that now works as a standalone game. With no plot or exact gameplay at all, anyone can create his own game mode to play for fun. You can find anything you&#39;re into. Trouble In Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Hunger Games, Franchise-based modes such as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings - anything. Basically, GMod stands for God Mode in video games, because you can play with any asset of the source engine. Try out physics, characters, maps, weaponry - anything. Based on that, Garry&#39;s Mod gives players quite a variety of mods to spend their time. It doesn&#39;t sound so earnestly. You will probably find something that will provide you with quite a good amount of fun. Servers are specifically sorted in game modes so you&#39;ll never play a different mode while playing exact one what you wanted. At the end of the day, this game is about receiving as much fun from what is happening around you as possible."

"description": "Carefully constructed horror game relies on positioning, camera work, and shocking content. But Amnesia: The Dark Descent adds psychological elements to it. Players control the young man named Daniel, who wakes up in a seemingly empty castle, alone and with a massive memory loss. Through environmental storytelling, notes, audio logs and even visions, players are invited to uncover the deep-rooted secrets of the castle. Throughout the game players will be introduced to the mechanics of Sanity, representing the mental state of Daniel which can be affected by lack of light, visions and even unpleasant encounters with the monsters. When decreased, Sanity will distort the vision of the player to a different and seemingly random effect, in order to depict actual effects of severe anxiety. Most of the game challenges are completed through the item search and physics puzzles, forcing players to be resourceful and courageous. The game supports modding, and allows user-created content alongside the free DLC Justine, telling a story of a female prisoner. Given how short the DLC story is - several possible endings are available."

"description": "A direct port of the original Deathmatch mode for the half-life to the Source engine slightly improves the game flow, by making controls more responsive and the connection more stable. Half-Life Deathmatch Source recreates the gameplay of the original multiplayer of Half-Life. All players are randomly spawned at the different map points and battle each other within a free-for-all brawl. To acquire any resource (weapons, ammo, health, and energy) players must scavenge the map for the various caches. Victory is achieved by obtaining the largest amount of kills during the match, by eliminating other players. In case of the draw, the player with the least amount of deaths is a winner of the match. Aside from the user created content, there are 8 available maps for the Half-Life Deathmatch: Source."

"description": "The Line is the tenth entry into the Spec Ops series, as well as a modernized reboot. Following the worst recorded sandstorms in Dubai, Captain Martin Walker was sent to investigate the events that took place in the city, after it was cut off from all transport and communication. So now the squad of the elite soldiers has to discover, what was meant by the last message they received from the dense wall of raging sand. Spec Ops: The Line places the attention on the squad mechanics, where players can give orders to the NPCs, accompanying the player during the game. Aside from the single-player story campaign, players can join the multiplayer matches, which may vary from the solo/team deathmatch to “King of the Hill” type matches. Cooperative missions for two players have been added shortly after the game release. The single player campaign allows players to experiment with the weapons, carrying two at a time and use the environments to their advantage, using hazardous sandstorm to clear-out the enemies."

"description": "Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man offers the player to take on the role of the most famous Marvel superhero. Plot The game introduces Spider-Man as an already experienced superhero. By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn&#39;t yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others. Gameplay The player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man&#39;s movements. As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them."

"description": "Welcome to Steelport, a city that’s been torn by the three violent gangs. And seemingly, only another violent gang can stop them. After merging with Ultor Corporation after the events of the second game, Boss and his lieutenants became a corporation of their own. And now, after a run-in with the corrupt police forces, when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate, alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support, 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. While being a third person action adventure game, Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically, shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions, even by the Saints Row standards, but customization items, transport, and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism."

"description": "In the future world, androids do almost everything that people do - they even start to think and feel. Although no one taught them this. The plot of Become Human is built around three characters, each with a separate storyline, but they eventually merge into a single picture. Connor is a police investigator and android. He has a simple task - to find androids, deviated from the path given by humans. He has a special vision, it allows him to see events as they happened. And the more information he collects, the higher his chances of acting correctly. Kara is an android-housekeeper which spontaneously develops self-consciousness. As a result, Kara assumes responsibility for the fate of the little girl whom she worked as a sitter for. She, along with the girl, escapes from the house as a result of a conflict with her father, the owner of Kara. Markus is a caretaker android. He also acquired self-consciousness and came to the idea that androids need freedom. He has the ability to grant androids free will and to calculate the consequences of some actions. The story develops depending on the decisions taken by the characters. Some decisions have to be made quickly. Sometimes a player can return to the moment of making a choice and replay the situation."

"description": "Prey (2017) is a single-player sci-fi first-person shooter developed by Arkane Studios Austin and published by Bethesda Softworks. While it is technically a reboot of the 2006 game of the same name developed by Human Head Studios, of which the sequel suffered a fall into development hell before the license was sold to Bethesda Softworks, there is no relation between the stories and universes of the two games. The game is set in the near future of an alternate reality. You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you&#39;ll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites. Prey&#39;s gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt."

Being a spin-off and developed by a different studio, Obsidian Entertainment, Fallout: New Vegas follows the Courier as he&#39;s ambushed by a gang lead by Benny, stealing a Platinum Chip and heavily wounded, practically left for dead. As he wakes up, he minds himself in the company of Doc Mitchell who saved our protagonist and patches him up. This section of the game is given for customising your characters, picking traits and the look of the main hero before embarking on his journey to retrieve Platinum Chip. New Vegas has very similar gameplay to Fallout 3 with a few improvements, such as iron sights for most of the guns, new animations for VATS kills, new perk Survivor, which allowed you to have more benefits from drinks and food you could craft and gambling in the casinos. Expanded crafting system, weapon modification system force player to scavenge for resources. Reputation system was reintroduced in New Vegas as old reputation system from Fallout 2, with Karma making a serious impact on the game."

Eventually, players will be tasked to find the first piece, of the Vault Key.

Cooperative in nature, Borderlands can be played with up to 3 other players in total, where players can take the roles of 4 different characters: Brick the Berserker, Mordecai the Hunter, Lilith the Siren and Roland the Soldier. Some characters are naturally proficient in specific weapons, but players are not constricted to the skill requirements. When a specific weapon type is used often – the more proficient players are. Borderlands have several story DLCs that either shift the tone of the main game or expand on the existing storyline and characters."

"description": "Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure game based on players’ stealth skill. The game is played from the first-person perspective and includes several RPG elements. It is a sequel to the original Dishonored game, so the story takes place in Dunwall and mostly in Karnaca 12 years after the ending of the previous part. To start the action, the player has to decide whether he wants to assume the role of deposed Empress Emily or the role of her father and the Royal Protector Corvo, the protagonist of the first Dishonored game. Both characters have their own bunch of special abilities so the choice will influence the way of returning to the throne. In the course of the game, both equipment and abilities can be upgraded. The storyline is divided into several main missions and includes various side quests that let protagonists get acquainted with the useful new skills. Although the gameplay is initially focused on the stealth, actually there is a multitude of ways to complete all the missions and to return the lost honor."

"description": "Don&#39;t Starve Together is surrealistic and grim survival game made up for six people simultaneously. Initially, Don&#39;t Starve is a single-player game with a core mechanic of going through various problems of your character. You have to sleep and eat well. Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don&#39;t go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart. It seems like the world of Don&#39;t Starve is heavily inspired by Tim Burton, having a very grotesque yet creepy and bizarre-looking monsters and locations with an atmospheric soundtrack. While heading to multiplayer, you will experience every single problem from a singles game. The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember. Don&#39;t Starve."

"description": "Dishonored is the game about stealth. Or action and killing people. It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress&#39; bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player&#39;s choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story."

"description": "Company of Heroes 2 is the second installment in the series of real-time strategy games, following its predecessor’s legacy as one of the most complex and realistic WWII simulators. New features and game engine improvements will provide the most intense experience of the most significant battles of both the Western and Eastern fronts of the war. After seven years since the first game’s release, Company of Heroes 2 provides the players with new battle mechanics, even more, micromanagement and new game modes, as well as an expanded single-player campaign, taking place in the Eastern front. The key features of the first game, being the dynamic environments and cover system, have also been overhauled, with additions as a line of sight for every troop. The warfare itself has also been changed, removing the mechanics of doctrines and adding traits to various generals on the field. The game also includes additional content, which adds two new Allied factions, the US expeditionary forces and the Royal Army, and new campaigns for both factions, while also improving performance and adding new features to the game, such as tech trees, various tactics and many more."

"description": "Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition is an extended version of fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us based on the imaginary universe of DC Comics. The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. Injustice: Gods Among Us is followed by the sequel Injustice 2."

"description": "A dark fantasy game that takes inspiration from Scandinavian and Celtic folklore, Hellblade is set in a gritty barbarian world full of weird wooden structures and creepily masked enemies. The player assumes the role of Senua, a traumatized female warrior from the Pict tribe. She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover&#39;s soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. When not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to focus and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional."

"description": "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person shooter with an open world. The game is set in a fictional city during the 1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III. The main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal. The worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases."

"description": "The direct sequel to the Hitman: Blood money, Absolution tells the story of Agent 47, the true intentions of his Agency and how top Agent became a renegade on the run. Unlike previous games in the series, players will get more linear and cinematic experience. The game revolves around objective-based missions, providing various methods of completion. Players can avoid direct confrontation by disguising themselves in other people’s uniforms and use environmental interactions to distract or kill unsuspecting targets. And in case of raising the alarm, players can try to rush the mission with the direct attack, using dozens of available weapons. Players can use special vision mechanic, called Instinct. It allows seeing through the solid surfaces in order to observe NPC’s, items that can be interacted with and predict the movement of patrolling guards. Absolution provides players with additional challenges and collectibles in order to invite players to explore the maps."

"description": "Super Meat Boy is a fast-paced 2D platform game that rewards mechanical perfection and accuracy of controls. Meat Boy has to save Bandage Girl from Doctor Fetus, by completing the platforming challenges. The game has 5 main worlds, each consisting of 20 light levels, 20 dark and harder versions of those levels and a boss fight. Meat Boy has only one life and cannot take any damage, but there is no limit on attempts, so players can try and fail the stage until they get it right or collect special bandages. Unique replay system will show the player every try they made at the same time right after they completed the level. Super Meat boy has multiple characters, some of them are a different skin for Meat Boy and in-game adaptations of other indie-game protagonists, that can be unlocked by completing their special challenge levels, hidden somewhere in the campaign; or by collecting set amount of bandages. Players will be able to choose any unlocked character for any level from the main menu. The game gives players access to the community created maps, but even without it – Super Meat Boy offers more than 300 levels."
